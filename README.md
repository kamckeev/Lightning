# Lightning
An investigation to incidences of lightning of the past thirty years

I am curious to see the weather patterns over time. The dateaset that I will be using is from NOAA. It would be interesting to see if there are trends of lightning over time as a whole, then more localized. 

It would be interesitng to create a gif showing the flow overtime over the entire united states

After that, seeing if there are correlations of anything at all that might indicate increases or decreases in lightning frequency.
